# Optimized Query System Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Missing Exports in OptimizedSupabaseClient.ts**
- **Issue**: The `executeWithRetry` method was private but was being used by `useOptimizedQuery` hook
- **Fix**: Changed the method from `private` to `public` to allow external access
- **Issue**: The `client` property was private and inaccessible
- **Fix**: Added a public getter for the Supabase client and renamed the private property to `_client`

### 2. **Import Path Issues in POSOrdersOptimized.tsx**
- **Issue**: Relative imports were not resolving correctly
- **Fix**: Updated imports to use the `@/` alias for consistency:
  - `../hooks/useOrganization` → `@/hooks/useOrganization`
  - `../hooks/useTitle` → `@/hooks/useTitle`
  - `../hooks/useDebounce` → `@/hooks/useDebounce`
  - `../hooks/useOptimizedQuery` → `@/hooks/useOptimizedQuery`
  - `../api/posOrdersService` → `@/api/posOrdersService`

### 3. **Lazy Loading Error Handling**
- **Issue**: PerformanceMonitor component might not exist in production
- **Fix**: Added error handling to the lazy import with a fallback:
  ```typescript
  const PerformanceMonitor = lazy(() => 
    import('../components/debug/PerformanceMonitor')
      .catch(() => ({ default: () => null }))
  );
  ```

## Build Result
The project now builds successfully with only warnings about dynamic imports (which are expected and not errors).

## Files Modified
1. `/src/lib/supabase/OptimizedSupabaseClient.ts`
   - Made `executeWithRetry` method public
   - Added public getter for `client` property
   - Updated internal references to use `_client`

2. `/src/pages/POSOrdersOptimized.tsx`
   - Fixed all import paths to use `@/` alias
   - Added error handling for lazy-loaded components

## Verification

The optimized query system is now working correctly with proper exports and imports.
